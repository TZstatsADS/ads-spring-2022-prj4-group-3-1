+ Project summary: Fairness has been a recent topic in machine learning. The aim of a fairness algorithm is to avoid the outcome decisions are being made unfairly to certain groups or individuals. We as a group, are trying to implement, evaluate, and compare LFR and PR algorithms for Machine Learning Fairness.
