+ Team members
	+ team member 1: Agarwal, Aakanksha (aa4863@columbia.edu)
	+ team member 2: He, Lichun (lh3094@columbia.edu)
	+ team member 3: Tang, Shiqi (st3349@columbia.edu)

	+ team member 5: Wang, Huiying (hw2816@columbia.edu)
+ Project summary: Fairness has been a recent topic in machine learning. The aim of a fairness algorithm is to avoid the outcome decisions are being made unfairly to certain groups or individuals. We as a group, are trying to implement, evaluate, and compare LFR and PR algorithms for Machine Learning Fairness. 
	
**Contribution statement**: 
+ All team members studied both fairness algorithms and attended all group meetings.
+ Aakanksha and Vasiliki implemented and evaluated the LFR algorithm (A1)
+ Lichun, Shiqi, and Huiying implemented and evaluated the PR algorithm (A5). 
+ Aakanksha and Vasiliki defined the evaluation metrics which are implemented on both models.
+ Lichun, Shiqi, and Huiying prepared the presentation slides.
+ The assigned presenter of this project is Lichun. 
+ All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
